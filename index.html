			<p class="cinfo">
				Software Developer with five years of experience specializing in web development, data processing, and software suite development for municipal and government offices. I have developed and implemented API modules, accounting systems, payment processing modules, database schemas, and entire site redesigns for both small and large scale projects. My greatest strengths are my analytical and organizational skills, which enable me to properly plan projects with AGILE methodologies and convey concepts across all levels of experience and technical acumen.

					<span class="header">Report Redesign - Lead Developer</span>
					<p><b>Problem:</b> Several municipal offices were having difficulty distinguishing information on revenue reports at a glance. When surveyed, not all offices wished to have distinguishing characteristics added to their reports.</p>
					<p><b>Solution:</b> Several additional configuration options were added to all municipal installs to allow for reports to be redesigned into a single, uniform format as well as toggle between color-themed reports and standard reports. All reports were modified to add classes to distinguishing elements, which would show colored rows on reports where the config option was enabled.</p>

					<span class="header">County Site Development - Lead Developer</span>
					<p><b>Problem:</b> As several municipal offices changed to our service, their prior services refused to maintain their public facing websites.</p>
					<p><b>Solution:</b> This issue was used to open a dialog with our municipal clients, offering them the ability to redesign their websites in a manner that they wanted. At the same time, the existing sites were either converted from unmaintained Joomla/Wordpress sites or redesigned entirely as HTML, CSS, &amp; PHP based websites. The files were made immutable, and hosted on secure servers with SSH access only.
					<p><b>Additional Details:</b> In 2017, most sites hosted in this manner were moved from standalone VM software to secure docker containers with git hooks to pull from internal repositories. This made updating and maintaining the sites faster and much easier.

					<span class="header">47th Infantry Reunion Website - Project Lead</span>
					<p><b>Problem:</b> The 47th Infantry Reunion Website needed several updates and new systems implemented while maintaining as much support for legacy browsers as possible.
					<p><b>Solution - Phase One:</b> The site was first assessed for which pages needed to be redesigned immediately and which systems needed to be updated. Reunions were held every two years - for the 2016 reunion, there was enough time to implement a few quality updates and add basic payment processing systems(eCheck).
					<p><b>Solution - Phase Two:</b> In late 2016, an entire modular redesign of the registration system was designed and implemented over the course of 2017. The system was designed in AngularJS with AJAX queries to a PHP based API. This allowed users to update their registration and see the changes in realtime via MVC methodologies. Once registration was complete, they were transferred to a PCI secure payment gateway(TLS 1.2) to process credit card and echeck payments. Transaction details were recorded in various states(incomplete, success, fail), and systems were put in place for registrants to pay for additional events, register additional guests, request refunds, and cancel their registration. Additional account management and report tools were developed for admin staff.
